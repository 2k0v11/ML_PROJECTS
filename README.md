## Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful field that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. This repository aims to provide a curated collection of ML models, along with explanations and practical examples.

## Models
### Classification
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method combining decision trees for improved accuracy.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Used for both binary and multi-class classification.
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm based on proximity to neighbors.
5. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model for text classification and spam detection.

### Regression
1. **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values based on input features.
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Combining weak learners to create a strong regression model.
3. **Lasso Regression**: Regularized linear regression with feature selection.
4. **Polynomial Regression**: Modeling non-linear relationships using polynomial features.
5. **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting framework for regression tasks.

### Clustering
1. **K-Means**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Creating a tree-like structure of clusters.
3. **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for irregularly shaped clusters.
4. **Agglomerative Clustering**: Bottom-up approach to cluster formation.

### Forecasting
1. **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA**: Predicting future values based on historical time series data.
2. **Prophet**: A robust forecasting tool developed by Facebook for business time series data.
3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Deep learning model for sequence prediction.
