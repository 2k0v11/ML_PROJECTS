# Machine Learning Models Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning models for various tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and forecasting. I started with these a year ago and hope to improve further with every project I undertake.

## Introduction
Machine learning is a powerful field that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. This repository aims to provide a curated collection of ML models, explanations, and practical examples.

## Models
### Classification
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method combining decision trees for improved accuracy.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Used for both binary and multi-class classification.
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm based on proximity to neighbors.

### Regression
**Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values based on input features.
**Lasso Regression**: Regularized linear regression with feature selection.



### Clustering
**K-Means**: Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity.
**DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for irregularly shaped clusters.


### Forecasting
 **Prophet**: A robust forecasting tool developed by Facebook for business time series data.
